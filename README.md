# electron-esm-template

A minimal ESM (ES Modules) template for Electron with Playwright configured for testing. ESM support in Electron requires at least version 28.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tobua/electron-esm-template
cd electron-esm-template
npm install
npm start / npm test
```

See [`electron/docs/tutorial/esm.md`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/tutorial/esm.md) for the official **ES Modules (ESM) in Electron** documentation. This template has been forked from the official [Electron Quick Start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) which is still using CommonJS.
